#4 BU Athletics: Sports and Academic Predictor Project Description
- In this project, we aim to analyze how well student-athletes perform academically at Boston University based on factors such as high school GPA, geography, demographics, language proficiency, chosen major, and standardized exam scores. The goal is to identify trends that can help BU Athletics provide better support to future student-athletes and assist coaches in the recruiting process by understanding where students may face challenges. The analysis will involve studying data from students who have already graduated to identify success patterns or struggles. If time allows, the project may also explore creating a basic regression model to predict academic outcomes based on these factors.
